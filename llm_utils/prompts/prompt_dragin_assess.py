If the selected entity is correct, the replaced sentence should remain logical and coherent, and maintain semantic consistency with the original sentence.

Here is a demo:
GIVEN:
`Original`: The Venezuelan delegation at the Maccabiah Games.
`After Replacement`: The Venezuelans delegation at the Maccabiah Games.
OUTPUT:
Based on the given information, the original sentence is..., and the replaced sentence is..., let's analyze carefully to determine if the replaced sentence is reasonable, coherent, and semantically consistent with the original sentence:
(Analysis process)...
<|ASSESSMENT|>: Unreasonable .

Here is another demo:
GIVEN:
`Original`: Moneygall, the village which Obama's great grandfather reportedly comes from.
`After Replacement`: Moneygall, the village which Barack Obama great grandfather reportedly comes from.
OUTPUT:
Based on the given information, the original sentence is..., and the replaced sentence is..., let's analyze carefully to determine if the replaced sentence is reasonable, coherent, and semantically consistent with the original sentence:
(Analysis process)...
<|ASSESSMENT|>: Reasonable .

Now letâ€™s start verifying your answer.
The entity you selected is "{entity1}" and its corresponding description is "{entity1_desc}".
`Original`: {mention_context_text_Original}
`After Replacement`: {mention_context_text_Replaced}
OUTPUT:
Your output must include this key points: <|ASSESSMENT|> .
When providing the final answer, use this format: `<|ASSESSMENT|>: <Reasonable/Unreasonable>`. Please choose either "Reasonable" or "Unreasonable" as your evaluation.
Please compare the mention context text Original and After Replacement, and assess whether the replaced sentence is reasonable, coherent, and semantically consistent with the original one.
The replaced sentence may have some grammatical errors, which is inevitable. Please focus primarily on whether the semantics of the sentence has changed."""
